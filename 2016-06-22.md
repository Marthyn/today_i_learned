# Vakmedianet

## Engine frustrations

So when you use an engine in Rails the routes you define in the engine can (but not always have to) be prefixed with the name of the engine. In our case, in some controllers the route helper `sign_up_path` does not work. It does always work with `vakmedianet.sign_up_path`

## Service customers

Main thing i learned about that today is that you need to tell them what you're doing over and over again, don't skip, don't assume they already know, no tell them everything every time again. Tuesday we had planned a production release with a customer, emailed about it multiple times but still he was not aware it was that precise moment, causing surprises with a lot of people. So we should've called before.

Rust could solve a big problem in Ruby, the speed. Rust is a super fast language and people have showed that by using Rust for some basic functions in Ruby you can achieve an enormous speed boost. I'm going to experiment with this.
